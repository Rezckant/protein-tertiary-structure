One of the main areas of research in molecular biology is the three-dimensional reconstruction of macromolecules such as proteins. Protein structure prediction is one of the main challenges in bioinformatics. Correct prediction of the single backbone of a tertiary structure is a major difficulty in determining the flexible torsion angles as well as the angles of the different side chains. On average, for a medium-sized protein, there are hundreds of variables in total. For this reason, soft computing technologies have been considered as good candidates to solve this type of NP-complete problems in recent years. This research presents an exploratory analysis and a prediction of the RMSD

**one of the best regression algorithms for this data set is the Random Forest, in which case an root-mean-square error of 3.60 was obtained after the processing presented here.**
